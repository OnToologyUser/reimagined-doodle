# Ontological approach using NER tagging for creating knowledge base of Indian Culture
The project presents a full-text query searching mechanism that gives precise results in a structured format. Here, our system scraps data from websites to collect information about Indian food, festivals, and weddings in different regions. The concepts of related data using ontology are inferred, with the potential to access several sources of data from various websites and derive new information from them. Natural Language Processing techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) are used to tag keywords in our data and user’s query to establish a relationship between the keywords by the help of which the user’s query is further converted to the corresponding SPARQL query, which is consequently used to extract relevant data from the ontology.
